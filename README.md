# Gerv-G Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages! Here I share thoughts on software development, programming, and career retrospectives.

## 🚀 Features

- Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the Chirpy theme (using [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter))
- Categorized and tagged for easy navigation
- Responsive, fast, and easy to maintain

## 🛠️ Local Development

To run the site locally in this dev container:

```sh
./tools/run.sh
```

Then open the local server URL in your browser.

To build the site for production:

```sh
./tools/test.sh
```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `_posts/` — Blog posts in Markdown
- `_data/` — Site data (authors, contact, etc.)
- `_tabs/` — Navigation tabs (About, Archives, Categories, Tags)
- `assets/` — Images and favicons
- `_plugins/` — Custom Jekyll plugins

## 📝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Though I'm wondering why you'd care that much :D
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you’d like to change.
