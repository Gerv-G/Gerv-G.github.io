_"Nako, ayan ka na naman. Ningas-kugon ka lang naman eh,"_ my mom would often say (“Oh no, here you go again. You never follow through”), casting doubts on my attempts to start a new routine or hobby.

I know you're wondering, but no, that's not the N-word - lest I get cancelled by the internet.
_Ningas-kugon_ is a Filipino idiom that literally means "to catch fire like a cogon grass". It describes someone who starts things with intense enthusiasm but quickly loses steam - like a _kugon_.

To be fair, she's not wrong.

Four years ago, I decided to give blogging a try. I wanted my thoughts to finally see the light of day instead of being locked away in an eternal drafts folder.

I already wrote about my struggles for and chalked it up to [procrastination]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/finally-starting-a-blog/#getting-over-perfectionism). I thought I was just waiting until each post was “good enough.”

There might be some truth to that, but I realize it's also a possibility that I was just making an excuse for my excuses.
Blogging is hard and if I’m being honest, I’m just lazy as f*ck.

Ningas-kugon? Guilty as charged.

## Hiatus x Hiatus

As I was trying to migrate my posts from [dev.to](https://dev.to/gervg) to this blog, I was reminded of a joke about [HUNTERxHUNTER's hiatus](https://hiatus-hiatus.github.io/) being longer than the times the chapters were published. I looked at my publication dates and I couldn't help but see the similarities.

I'd love to say I was busy living my life to the fullest, but really I was mostly just doom scrolling and sending memes to my friends. I haven't even seriously touched the piano in forever. These days, it's more like "Oops, that's the wrong chord. Welp, practice done".I've basically forgotten all my repertoire (if that handful of intros and choruses even count).

Lovelife? `NullReferenceException`.
If you really want a story, ask my neighbour’s cat. Her dating life’s probably more exciting than mine.

While delayed gratification in music may have lost its magic on me, I am at least proud to say that I am no longer a full-time couch potato. I’ve been promoted to part-time spud.

I started going to the pain dungeon called gym 1-3 times a week, with an occasional 4th when I felt like I haven't sacrificed enough sweat tribute to appease the swole gods. Turns out, lifting heavy things and making weird faces while hoping the gym doesn't revoke my pass is a fun thing to do. Will this be a fitness blog? No. But will I make gym analogies and joke? Definitely.

## So what changed?

While writing this, I kinda regretted putting in this section mostly because I can't point to a single moment that launched me into some definitive character development arc (sort of… jury’s still out on that one).

But one thing that did stand out: I’ve been seeing a lot of interesting, talented folks in our [community](https://discord.com/servers/pandesal-dev-748554476398444635) starting their own projects, things they can actually showcase. In one way or another, they’ve built something they can be proud of. Meanwhile, I had a Notion graveyard and a bunch of TODO comments.

Realistically, I don't think I have the time and energy (or maybe I just lack motiviation) to do another coding project. And besides, I'm already doing a lot of that at work. But building software is still one of my passions and I want it to be related to it.

Then I remembered my blog in dev.to

### Something of my own

While dev.to is great and very straightforward to use, the topics I’ve seen there lately don’t quite align with the things I want to talk about. I wanted to share about my personal journey, the lessons, and the odd misadventures - things that don't always jive with the frequent technical deep-dives and how-tos on the platform. The same goes for most other tech blogging spaces, too. But can you blame them? They're just functioning as intended.

_So, Gerv, do you want your own blogsite?_

YES! But I'm a cheapskate who doesn't want to spend a single cent. So here we are, on GitHub pages.

**Pros:** I finally dove into Jekyll, which I mostly ignored back when I was writing on dev.to. I also set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically publish my posts, and even updated the RSS feed link on my profile so the latest posts show up there.

**Cons:** My goodness, I just wanted to write a blog. And yet, here I am, overthinking whether I'll need a CDN for the photos I'll use in this blog.
