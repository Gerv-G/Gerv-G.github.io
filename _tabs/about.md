## â˜• Full-stack; Half-awake

Hey folks, I'm Gervin Guevarra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a ~~software engineer~~ professional bug maker, a recovering caffeine-addict, and meme dealer.
Despite my blog's tagline, I do get some sleep. Just... not always when I should.

Welcome to a piece of my mind. This is a place where I'll dump my thoughts, lessons, and rants that come with working in tech. Occassionally, I'll write stuff about life because, after all, developers are people too.

## ðŸ§° What I Do

Most of my day job revolves around backend (C#/.NET), but I also poke around frontend (React) and infra (AWS) when I need to.
Iâ€™m also the kind of person who actually likes writing documentation. Donâ€™t judge.

## ðŸ“« Let's connect

If you want to say hi, argue whether `snake_case` is just `camelCase` that gave up on life, or collaborate on something cool (no guarantees I'll say yes - I'm lazy af),
you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gerv-G) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gervin-guevarra/), or shoot me an email at [gerv.guev.dev@gmail.com](mailto:gerv.guev.dev@gmail.com).

Aaaand if a chaotically fun dev community is right in your alley, join us at [pandesal.dev](https://discord.com/servers/pandesal-dev-748554476398444635)!

## ðŸ’° Tips/Donations

I don't know why you would, but if you have trouble finding ways to spend your money, then just give it to me. I'll buy coffee.
